This folder contains a LAMMPS data file and a file with LAMMPS formatted force-field parameters for a small Nafion system. 

The files ending in 'no_platinum' do not account for the platinum interface (i.e. the data file does not have coordinates for the platinum, and there are no parameters for the platinum in the force-field file). The system with no platinum contains 1 monomer unit and 6 waters, 89 atoms total. The system with platinum contains 1 monomer unit, 6 waters and 16 platinums, 105 atoms total.
